            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Personal Information</h3>
            <p>
              Personal Information includes any data by which an individual can be identified or located. We collect and use your personal information to provide our IT support products and services to you, and to operate and improve our site and services. We will only use your personal information in ways outlined in this Privacy Policy.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Client Information</h3>
            <p>
              Client Information is information that we may collect from your use of our website and your interactions with us off-line. We deal with client information according to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Accessing Our Website</h3>
            
            <h4 className="text-lg font-medium text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">Log Files</h4>
            <p>
              Like most websites, our site automatically collects and uses the data contained in log files. Information in log files may include your computer's IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider), the web browser you used to visit our site, the time you visited our site, which web pages you visited, and other anonymous site usage data.
            </p>

            <h4 className="text-lg font-medium text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">Information You Provide</h4>
            <p>
              We offer access to our website without requesting that you provide personal information, however, you may provide us personally identifiable information (such as your name, email address, phone number, and practice information) if you use our assessment request form or contact us through our website. You may also voluntarily provide us personal information if you email us directly with questions or schedule a consultation.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Services Data</h3>
            <p>
              Services Data is information and data that resides on our clients' or third-party systems to which ManagedSpa is provided access to perform IT support services (including production, development and test environments that may be accessed to perform technical support, system monitoring, and maintenance services). ManagedSpa treats services data in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy, except where the confidentiality provisions within a written contract with a client define different requirements.
            </p>

            <p>
              To illustrate the difference between client information and services data: when a client contracts with us for IT services, the client provides information about itself, including its name, business and email addresses, billing information, and some employee contact information. When a client uses our website to contact us or learn about our services, our website also collects information about the client. All such information is client information, and is treated according to this Privacy Policy.
            </p>

            <p>
              In contrast, when a client contracts with us to perform IT services, that client may provide us with access to their systems, networks, and data, which may include personal information about its employees, patients, or customers. All such information is services data.
            </p>

            <h4 className="text-lg font-medium text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">Conditions for Accessing Services Data:</h4>
            
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
              <li><strong>To Provide IT Services:</strong> We may access and use services data to fulfill our obligations under a contract or statement of work with a client, including system monitoring, technical support, and maintenance.</li>
              <li><strong>To Maintain and Upgrade Systems:</strong> Technical staff may require periodic access to services data to monitor system performance, test systems and develop and implement upgrades to systems, if applicable.</li>
              <li><strong>To Address Performance and Fix Issues:</strong> We may need to access client systems and data to deploy updates, patches, and fixes to resolve technical issues.</li>
              <li><strong>Subcontractors:</strong> If we hire subcontractors to assist in providing our services, their access to services data will be consistent with the terms of this Privacy Policy and client contracts.</li>
