Q1: Would you like a version of this checklist as a client-facing scorecard for onboarding/discovery?
Q2: Should I develop a visual flowchart that illustrates the automation workflows end-to-end (e.g., Make.com logic)?
Q3: Would you like this turned into a Notion or Replit-based template for internal team use?
Q4: Do you want a pricing calculator tied to the checklist (e.g., per-seat, per-location, per-integration)?
Q5: Are there specific tools or vendors you’d like pre-recommended and included as preferred options for each checklist line?

Let me know and I can format or expand this for client use, sales enablement, or internal SOP development.
