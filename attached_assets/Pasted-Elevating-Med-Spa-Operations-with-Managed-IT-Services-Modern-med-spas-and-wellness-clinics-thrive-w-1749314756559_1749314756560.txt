Elevating Med Spa Operations with Managed IT Services

Modern med spas and wellness clinics thrive when their technology is seamless, secure, and tailored to their unique workflows. Facet Interactive’s ManagedSpa IT services empower med spa owners with peace of mind and freedom from tech hassles, so you can focus on delivering exceptional client experiences. The following sections showcase how we integrate and manage critical systems – from medical records to customer communications to automation – all designed for peace of mind and operational empowerment.

EHR/EMR Integration and Management

Med spas rely on specialized Electronic Health Record (EHR) and Electronic Medical Record (EMR) platforms to manage everything from appointments to clinical notes. Facet supports and integrates purpose-built wellness practice platforms like Aesthetic Record, Symplast, Nextech, and other industry-specific EMRs. We ensure these systems work in harmony with your operations, with an emphasis on HIPAA-compliant support, secure access, and reducing your team’s administrative burden.
	•	Aesthetic Record – All-in-One Med Spa EMR: Aesthetic Record is a HIPAA-compliant practice management and EMR solution created specifically for medical spas and wellness clinics ￼. It integrates charting, telehealth, before/after photos, point-of-sale, online booking, inventory, loyalty programs, third-party CRM integration, and KPI reporting in one platform ￼. We help med spas fully leverage Aesthetic Record’s features, so patient data flows securely and your staff can access everything they need in one place.
	•	Symplast – Mobile Cloud EHR for Aesthetics: Symplast is the #1 mobile EHR/practice management platform for plastic surgery and med spa businesses ￼. It offers “one complete platform” with intuitive charting optimized for aesthetic workflows and a patient app for two-way engagement ￼ ￼. Notably, Symplast includes front desk automation to remove tedious tasks from your staff’s plate ￼. Facet’s team ensures Symplast is configured to streamline your check-ins, digital forms, and patient communications – all with HIPAA-secure access for providers and clients ￼.
	•	Nextech – Scalable Med Spa Software: Nextech is a robust med spa management software suite that can scale from single-location clinics to multi-site enterprises ￼. It boasts HIPAA-compliant data security, hosting client records in a certified cloud datacenter with multiple layers of physical and digital protection ￼. Facet facilitates Nextech integration and management, ensuring your med spa’s data privacy is never compromised while connecting Nextech with your other systems (like billing or marketing).

By partnering with Facet, your med spa gains a tech liaison who speaks the language of both healthcare and IT. We coordinate with software vendors (e.g. contacting Aesthetic Record or Symplast support on your behalf) to resolve issues and implement new features. Our experts handle updates, backups, and interoperability between your EMR and other tools, lightening the administrative load on your team. Modern medspa software is proven to “streamline…workflow, reduce administrative burden, and ensure high-quality patient care” ￼ – Facet makes sure you realize these benefits without worrying about the technical details. Enjoy peace of mind knowing that your electronic records are fully supported, compliant, and optimized to keep your practice running smoothly.

CRM and Multi-Channel Chat Management

Today’s med spa client expects personalized attention across multiple communication channels – from emails and texts to social media messaging. Facet’s managed IT services help unify your Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems and messaging platforms into a cohesive, easy-to-manage hub. We support popular med spa CRM solutions like HighLevel (GoHighLevel), Pabau, and HubSpot, as well as SMS marketing tools and social messaging on WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram. Our team ensures all these channels come together seamlessly, so your staff can engage with clients without juggling separate apps.
	•	Unified CRM Support: We integrate and maintain CRM systems tailored to med spas. For example, Pabau is an all-in-one clinic management platform that helps deliver a smooth client journey for aesthetic clinics ￼. Whether you use a niche medspa CRM like Pabau or a broader platform like HubSpot, Facet will tie it into your daily operations – syncing it with your scheduling, forms, and marketing efforts. This means your client contacts, treatment history, and leads are all in one place, giving you a 360° view of each client.
	•	Multi-Channel Messaging: Med spa teams often handle inquiries and follow-ups via text messages, social media DMs, live chat, and phone calls. We simplify this by implementing omni-channel communication hubs. For example, we can extend your Microsoft Teams Phone System into a full contact center that brings together SMS, WhatsApp, web chat, social messaging, email, and voice calls – all inside Teams ￼. Your front-desk or call center staff get a single interface for every client interaction, creating “the ultimate agent desktop experience” ￼. If your team prefers Slack, we can similarly integrate SMS and call notifications into Slack channels (using solutions like Aloware’s cloud contact center integration) so Slack becomes a collaboration hub for client communications ￼.
	•	Centralized Booking & Support Desk: By unifying chats and inquiries, Facet helps you establish a centralized ticketing or messaging system for bookings and customer service. A Facebook or Instagram message asking about a treatment, an SMS confirming an appointment, and an email inquiry from your website can all funnel into one queue. No more bouncing between a cell phone, Facebook Messenger, and email – your team can respond quickly from one dashboard, ensuring no lead falls through the cracks. This not only saves time but also provides clients with prompt, consistent responses. The result is a smoother customer experience and less stress for your staff.

With Facet managing your CRM and communications tech, your med spa gains a modern, unified communications workflow. Clients can reach out on their preferred channel, while your team enjoys the freedom of a simplified, integrated system. We also implement proper security and compliance (critical when handling personal data over chat) so that all client interactions remain confidential and protected. Ultimately, our multi-channel integration gives you peace of mind that every message is answered and every relationship nurtured – boosting satisfaction and conversion rates.

Med Spa Automation

Imagine your med spa running like a well-oiled machine, where many of the routine tasks happen automatically in the background. Facet’s business process automation (BPA) services help achieve exactly that. We leverage powerful automation platforms like Make.com and n8n (along with tools like Zapier or Power Automate as needed) to connect your various systems and automate key workflows. The goal is to build scalable, low-labor operations – freeing your team from repetitive tasks and ensuring nothing falls through the cracks. Automation brings peace of mind by handling the details consistently, and it provides owners the freedom to focus on growth rather than micromanaging processes. Here are some high-impact med spa automation use cases we implement:
	•	Customer Lifecycle Management: Keep clients engaged at every stage of their journey without manual effort. For example, we can set up automated welcome emails or SMS for new inquiries, educational content drips for pre-treatment prospects, and post-treatment check-ins for recent patients. Automation can eliminate tedious tasks and ensure every client gets the right touch at the right time, giving you more time to spend with patients ￼ ￼. Consistent, personalized outreach throughout the customer lifecycle leads to higher satisfaction and more return visits ￼.
	•	Recurring Billing and Memberships: If your med spa offers membership programs or packages (e.g. monthly facials or injectable plans), we automate the recurring billing and renewal reminders. No more manually charging cards or tracking expirations – the system will automatically process membership fees and notify clients of upcoming renewals. For instance, you can “create custom membership programs with automatic renewal and payment options to keep everything simple” ￼. This ensures steady revenue and a seamless experience for your members, with minimal administrative oversight.
	•	Follow-Up Sequences and Rebooking Prompts: Never miss an opportunity to re-engage a client. We configure sequences that trigger after a client’s visit or a specific treatment. These might include an automatic thank-you message with post-care instructions the day after a procedure, a follow-up email asking for feedback or offering a special on their next visit a week later, and a reminder when it’s time to rebook. Advanced medspa software already shows the value of such engagement – for example, appointment reminders and post-procedure follow-ups can be automated, keeping clients informed and improving retention ￼. With Facet’s automations, you can “boost rebookings” and even increase upsells by staying proactively in touch with clients ￼. All of this happens without your team having to remember schedule intervals – “the right message at the right time – without lifting a finger” ￼.
	•	Churn Prediction and Win-Back Campaigns: Retaining clients is just as important as acquiring new ones. We deploy analytics and AI tools that monitor client engagement and identify signs of inactivity or attrition (for example, someone who usually books monthly but hasn’t in 3 months). Using platforms like Make.com or n8n, these insights can trigger win-back automations – perhaps sending a personalized “We miss you” offer or alerting your staff to reach out personally. Modern wellness software is even using machine learning to flag at-risk clients; for instance, AI can analyze thousands of data points to predict if clients are likely to churn in the next 30 days ￼. Facet helps you tap into this power, so you can address client churn proactively. By tying your EMR, CRM, and marketing data together, we enable intelligent retention campaigns (such as special promotions for dormant clients or VIP treatment for high-value customers) to maximize client lifetime value.

Behind the scenes, we build these automations on reliable platforms – Make.com, for example, is an advanced automation tool that connects your favorite apps and ensures everything works together seamlessly ￼. Similarly, n8n is a flexible workflow engine that gives us the freedom to implement multi-step integrations customized to your needs ￼. Our team handles all the technical setup: defining triggers (events like a completed appointment, a failed payment, or a new lead) and actions (sending messages, updating records, creating tasks) that follow your business rules. We also maintain these workflows over time, so if you adopt a new software or want to tweak a process, we adjust the automations accordingly.

The result is a med spa operation that runs smoothly on autopilot for routine processes. Owners and managers get real-time visibility into what’s happening – with dashboards and alerts if anything needs attention – but don’t have to manually push every button. Freedom from tech concerns is our mantra: by entrusting Facet with your med spa’s automation, you gain a partner dedicated to making sure every system talks to each other and every repetitive task is handled accurately. In short, you can relax and provide top-notch service while the modern digital operations hum along in the background, driving growth and consistency for your clinic.
